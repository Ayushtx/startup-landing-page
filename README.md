# website-1.0
Website based on HTML and CSS with responsive layout. First Project in my journey to be a JavaScript developer.

So i created this website as to test my coding skills.
I just went on Chrome searched for the Figma UI Desing.

Then made this whole website with Html and CSS along with Grid and Media Queries.
Utility.css is for some sample utility classes
Mobile.css is to make my site responsive with respect to the mobile dimensions.
